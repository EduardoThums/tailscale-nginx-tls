# Tailscale Nginx TLS

# Tailscale Nginx TLS

This project serves as a study project to learn how to configure an Nginx instance inside Docker that is exposed through a Tailscale tailnet with a TLS certificate generated by Tailscale. The setup demonstrates how to:

- Run Nginx in a Docker container
- Connect the container to Tailscale
- Generate and use Tailscale TLS certificates
- Configure Nginx to serve content securely

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Tailscale account and CLI
- Basic understanding of Docker and Nginx configuration

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EduardoThums/tailscale-nginx-tls.git
   cd tailscale-nginx-tls
   ```

2. Generate the TLS certificate on tailscale
   ```bash
   cd certificates
   tailscale cert your-domain.ts.net
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker container:
   ```bash
   TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME=your-domain.ts.net docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify the container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. Access your Nginx server through the Tailscale network using the hostname you configured.

   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.ts.net
   ```
